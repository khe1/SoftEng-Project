SoftEng-Project
===============
Our project is a mobile physics app aimed at non-engineering students. The app itself will focus on SLU Intro to Physics 1/2 and will use example from the course textbook (Griffiths) and other problems that we deem helpful. It will help with homework problems from the textbook and (possibly) show the desired equations for each problem and how to get the answer sort of like Wolfram Alpha. The app will be developed primarily for Android devices but Apple is also possible.
